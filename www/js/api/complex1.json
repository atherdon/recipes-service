Weeknight Chicken Posole with Warm Corn Tortillas

Posole is a traditional Mexican soup or stew made with either chicken or pork, seasoned with spices, and slow cooked all day. Our version is a quick fix, but you could easily convert it to a slow cooker recipe by simply placing all the ingredients in the slow cooker and cooking on low for about 7-8 hours. Either way, the combination of tender meat, hominy, and spices is delicious garnished with any number of toppings. We chose cilantro, tomatoes, radish, and avocado. Chopped lettuce or cabbage is also common as well. Enjoy!
