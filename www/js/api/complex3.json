Slow Cooker Beef Bolognaise and Simple Green Beans

Pull out the slow cooker! This is a fabulous sauce and is packed with flavor!  If spaghetti with meat sauce is a favorite at your house like it is at mine, double the recipe. It keeps in the freezer for months. Our family prefers spaghetti, but I really like rigatoni. The holes grab onto the sauce! A few green beans or a side salad and you’re set!
