Chicken Chickpeas and Kale in Pomodoro Sauce and Warm Bread
I could eat this sauce all day long! It's absolutely delicious. Serving it with chickpeas is a nice change of pace to pasta and wonderful with tender kale and crispy chicken. Mop up any leftover sauce with a piece of warm bread. Yum!

French Bread
SERVINGS : 4 PEOPLE COOK TIME : 10 MINUTES

1 loaf French bread (small)

Place in heated oven until heated through.



Chicken Chickpeas and Kale in Pomodoro Sauce
SERVINGS : 4 PEOPLE COOK TIME : 25 MINUTES PREP TIME : 10 MINUTES

4 bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs
kosher salt and pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
28 ounces whole peeled tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram
kosher salt and pepper, to taste
30 ounces chickpeas, drained
1/2 pound kale, chopped
1/4 cup parmesan, grated


Season chicken with kosher salt and pepper.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat.
Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the chicken, skin side down. Let cook for 3-4 minutes without moving to create a deep brown crispy skin.
Transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve.
Cook the garlic for just a minute, being careful not to brown.
Add tomatoes, marjoram, salt and pepper. Using a potato masher or the back of a slotted spoon, break down the tomatoes.
Transfer the chicken back to the skillet, skin side up. Attempt to leave the skin exposed and not covered in sauce. This will help keep it crispy.
Turn the heat to medium and let cook, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
Plate the chicken.
Stir the chickpeas and kale into the sauce. Let cook for about 5 minutes or until kale is slightly wilted.
Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
Spoon sauce around plated chicken and garnish with grated parmesan.
